# BLIPPO
First application I ever made, using the fantastic library [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). The app was developed during course [1dv430](http://coursepress.lnu.se/kurs/individuellt-mjukvaruutvecklingsprojekt/) at Linnaeus University. Blippo will be re-written in the near future since the codebase is lacking code quality. There is a PhoneGap-build included as well that I tried on some ios and android simulators but this was a while ago and I'm not sure whether it's still working as intended.


You can still run the application locally:
## INSTALL

1. Download or Clone
2. Install dependencies `npm install`.
3. Start the development server `npm start`.
4. App accessable on `http://localhost:3000`
